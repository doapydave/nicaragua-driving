Nicaragua Driving
==========================

An racing game in HTML5 and Javascript

 * [play the game](http://doap.com/projects/racer/v4.final.html)

4 levels:

 San Juan del Sur
 Ochomogo
 Jinotepe
 Managua

Currently supported browsers include:

 * Firefox (v12+) works great, 60fps at high res - Nice!
 * Chrome (v19+) works great, 60fps at high res... provided you dont have a bad GPU driver
 * IE9 - ok, 30fps at medium res... not great, but at least it works

The current state of mobile browser performance is pretty dismal. Dont expect this to be playable on
any mobile device.

Missing from this game:

 * car sound fx
 * better synchronized music
 * full screen mode
 * HUD fx (flash on fastest lap, confetti, color coded speedometer, etc)
 * more accurate sprite collision
 * better car AI (steering, braking etc)
 * an actual crash when colliding at high speed
 * more bounce when car is off road
 * screen shake when off-road or collision
 * throw up dirt particles when off road
 * more dynamic camera (lower at faster speed, swoop over hills etc)
 * automatic resolution & drawDistance detection
 * projection based curves ? x,y rotation
 * sub-pixel aliasing artifacts on curves
 * smarter fog to cover sprites (blue against sky, cover sprites)
 * multiple stages, different maps
 * a lap map, with current position indicator
 * road splits and joins
 * day/night cycle
 * weather effects
 * tunnels, bridges, clouds, walls, buildings
 * city, desert, ocean
 * add city of seattle and space needle to background
 * 'bad guys' - add some competetor drivers to race against as well as the 'traffic'
 * different game modes - fastest lap, 1-on-1 racing, collect coins ? shoot bad guys ?
 * a whole lot of gameplay tuning
 * ...
